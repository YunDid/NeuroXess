    """
    Power Spectral Density (PSD) estimate via the Thomson multitaper
    method (MTM).

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        A discrete-time signal, the size of x is [T, C], where T means the
        time points of samples, and  C means the channels of the signal.
        If x is a vector with [T,] shape, it is converted to [T, 1] and treated
        as singal channel.
    NW : float, optional
        The "time-bandwidth product" for the discrete prolate spheroidal
        sequences (or Slepian sequences) used as data windows.
        Typical choices for NW are 2, 5/2, 3, 7/2, or 4. Default: 4
    nfft : int, optional
        Specifies the FFT length used to calculate the PSD estimates.
        For real X, Pxx has (nfft / 2 + 1) columns if nfft is even,
        and (nfft + 1) / 2 columns if nfft is odd. For complex X, Pxx always
        has length nfft. If nfft is specified as empty, nfft is set to either
        256 or the next power of 2 greater than the length of X, whichever
        is larger.
    fs : int, optional
        The sampling frequency specified in hertz. If fs is empty, it defaults
        to 1 Hz.
    dlt : bool, optional
        Specifies whether drop the last taper.
        By default, it's true because the last taper's corresponding
        eigenvalue is significantly smaller than 1. Therefore, The number
        of tapers used to form Pxx is 2 * NW - 1.
    method : str, optional
        The method used for combining the individual spectral estimates:
        'adapt' - Thomson's adaptive non-linear combination (default)
        'unity' - linear combination with unity weights.
        'eigen' - linear combination with eigenvalue weight.

    Returns
    -------
    Pxx : array_like
        The PSD estimate of input x.
        Pxx is computed independently for each channel of x and stored in the
        corresponding row. Pxx is the distribution of power per unit frequency.
        The frequency is expressed in units of radians/sample.
        For real signals, the retured PSD is one-sided; for complex signals,
        it returns the two-sided PSD.
        Note that a one-sided PSD contains the total power of the input signal.
    f : array_like
        f is the vector of frequencies (in hertz) at which the PSD is
        estimated. For real signals, f spans the interval [0, Fs / 2] when nfft
        is even and [0, Fs / 2) when nfft is odd. For complex signals, f always
        spans the interval [0,Fs).
