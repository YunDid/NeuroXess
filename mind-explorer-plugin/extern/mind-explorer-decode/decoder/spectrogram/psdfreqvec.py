    Return a frequency vector in radians based on the number of points
    specified in NPTS.
    The vector returned assumes 2pi periodicity.

    Parameters
    ----------
    npts: specifies the number of sampling points.

    fs: specifies the sampling frequency in hertz. \
        By default fs is set to empty indicating normalized frequency.

    centerDC: specifies a boolean value in CENTERDC, \
        which indicates if zero hertz should be in the center of the frequency
        vector. CENTERDC can be one of these two values: False | True.

    freq_range: specifies the range of frequency in RANGE.
        RANGE can be one of the two strings: 'whole' | 'half'.

        Assuming CenterDC = false then:
            'whole' = [0, 2pi)
            'half'  = [0, pi] for even NPTS or [0, pi) for odd NPTS
        When CenterDC=true then:
            'whole' = (-pi, pi] for even NPTs or (-pi, pi) for odd NPTs
            'half'  = [-pi/2, pi/2] for even* NPTS or (-pi/2, pi/2) for odd
            NPTS When NPTS is not divisible by 4, then the range is
            (-pi/2, pi/2).

        When freq_range='half' the frequency vector has length (NPTS/2+1) if
        NPTS is even**, and (NPTS+1)/2 if NPTS is odd***.

            ** If centerDC=True and the number of points specified is even is
            not divisible by 4, then the number of points returned is NPTS/2.
            This is to avoid frequency points outside the range [-pi/2 pi/2].

            *** If centerDC=True and the number of points NPTS specified is odd
            and (NPTS+1)/2 is even then the length of the frequency vector is
            (NPTS-1)/2.
